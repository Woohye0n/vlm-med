# MMXU: A Multi-Modal and Multi-X-ray Understanding Dataset for Disease Progression
## case study
The case.pdf presents more examples.
Among them, Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 demonstrate three "hard" cases containing confounding options, where the red options represent the confounding options (i.e., options with the same variation category as the correct one). For Case 3, the two similar options have worsening outcomes in different directions; for Case 2, the two similar options show improvements to different extents.
Case 3 and Case 4 respectively show situations where the MAG does not work, meaning that the original severity of the disease involved in the problem cannot be reflected in the existing reports. Although the previous reports contain descriptions of related areas, since they do not address the question posed, introducing MAG after the modelâ€™s MMXU-dev fine-tuning does not help and can even mislead the model to give incorrect answers.
